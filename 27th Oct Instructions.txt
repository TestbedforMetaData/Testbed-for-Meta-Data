1. Sql file for the current database is "Latest_Database.sql", you will have to delete the old one.
2. I also prepared a diagram for the current database.
3. Relations are created in CakePHP, not in mySQL.
4. I created a virtual property for options in question entities. You can acces it by $question->options.
5. Questions have a type_id property. 1 = Text, 2 = Radio, 3 = Checkbox.
6. Compilation parts have a type property. It can be "Document" or "Question". They also have part_id property, it is the id of the question or document.
7. Right now, admin part has only "add" functionality for questions,documents and compilations. I will write the delete and update parts.
8. I added a few documents, questions and a compilation. With these, main application can be crated and tested.
