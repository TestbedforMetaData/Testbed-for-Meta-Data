1. For answers, I created three tables : subjects, answers, multiple_answers.
2. subjects table contains the name of the user using the application. I'm thinking it can come from a textbox at the beggining of application.
3. answers table contains the answers given by the subject.
	a. question_id : id of the question.
	b. answer_text : if the question type is text, answer will be written here, otherwise it will be empty.
	c. answer_option_id : if the question type is radio, this will contain the id of the selected option, otherwise it will be -1.
	d. is_multiple : if the question type is checkbox, this will be 1, otherwise 0.
	e. subect_id : id of the subject.
	f. visible_order : order with which the admin see it in answers page.
4. multiple_answers table contains the answer options of checkbox questions.
	a. option_id : id of the selected options.
	b. answer_id : id of the answer it belongs to.
