1. I added the compilation and link name to answer page. But we need to add an integer column named comp_id to subjects table.
2. Question update text now works with tinyMCE.
3. On the bottom of the answers page, there is an excel export button. It creates a single column excel with subject name, compilation name, questions and answers.
